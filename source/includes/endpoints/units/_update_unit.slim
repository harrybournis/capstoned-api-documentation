	p Update a Unit. A Unit belongs to a Department. If a department_id is supplied in the params, the unit will become associated with an existing Department. If department_attributes are present, then a new Department will be created and associated with the Unit. In case both department_id, and department_attributes are present, the department_id takes precedence, and the new Unit is associated with an existing Department.
