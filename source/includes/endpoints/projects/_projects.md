# Projects

<p class="short-description">'Projects belong to Assignments, and contain many Students'</p>

Projects contain many Students that participate in a Assignment. A Project has an enrollment key,
which Student will use to become members of the Project, and by extension, participate in a
Assignment. By default, a Project contains a generic name and no logo, but both can be updated
by its Student members.
