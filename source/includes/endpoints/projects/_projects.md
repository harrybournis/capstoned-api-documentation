# Projects

<p class="short-description">'Projects belong to Assignments, and contain many Students'</p>

Projects contain many Students that participate in a Assignment. A Project has an enrollment key,
which Student will use to become members of the Project, and by extension, participate in a
Assignment. The Lecturer defines the project_name, and the the team_name is autogenerated by the
system. The students can change the team_name and the logo if they wish.

A project also contains the field 'pending_project_evaluations' that indicates if there are pending project evaluations
to be completed.
