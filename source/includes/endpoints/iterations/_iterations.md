# Iterations

<p class="short-description">'An Assignment may have one or more Iterations'</p>

Each Assignment can have many iterations which are connected with a form. A Lecturer creates Iterations for an Assignment, and Studens must submit peer evaluation forms for each Iteration. Each Iteration has its own PAForm and Project Evaluations.
